							need to be considered when finding the correct ratio of Macro-nutrients. I recommend you experiment with your <b>Macro-Ratio</b>
							to find what works best with your body. Below is an example of the Macro-ratio I typically use on a daily basis to gain lean mass.
							(1-2lbs bodyweight per month)

						<u>Macro Ratio that I use:</u>
						<ul>
							<li> <b> Protein </b> 1g - 1.5g per 1lb of body mass </li>
							<li> <b> Carbs </b> 2g - 2.5g per 1lb of body mass </li>

								<h4 class="card-title">Top Carb Vegan Foods</h4>
								<p class="card-text">			
								An optimal diet plan must consist of a <b>variety of sources</b> of Carbohydrates. Understanding which carbohydrates are necessary for what portion of the day is imporant for not only physical
								health but also mental health and well-being. Not only are carbohydrates necessary for heavy weightlifting they are also necessary in promoting muscle growth through pre and post-workout nutrition.
								These carbs are very easy to find in your local area and are definitely worth considering for <b> Muscle Progression </b>.
								<h5>Complex Carbohydrates</h4>
								<b>Complex Carbs</b> are one of the most overlooked types of carbohydrates when looking at a well balanced diet. It makes sense that most meals for a bodybuilder should consist of <b>slow release
								energy foods</b> and that's exactly what Complex Carbs provides. My diet will mainly consist of <b>wholegrain foods</b>, since these are easy to obtain complex carb based foods on-the-go. <br />
								Here are a list of complex carbs:</p>
								<ol>
									<li> Oats </li>
									<li> Wholegrain Bread, Rice & Pasta</li>
									<li> Sweet Potato </li>
								</ol>
								<h5>Simple Carbohydrates</h4>
								<b>Simple Carbs</b> are very easy to obtain and can consist of healthy/non-healthy foods whereas complex carb foods are usually healthy. Simply put; Simple Carbs are <b>sugar-based quick release energy foods</b>
								and can provide useful for pre and post-workout nutrition. The reason for this is that workouts tend to last small durations of time (1-2 hours) and our bodies will work best with a quick release of energy 
								throughout this duration. It is also worth noting that for post-workout nutrition; simple carbs are great for <b>Glycogen Replenishment</b> which promotes muscle progression.
								Here are a list of simple carbs: </p>
								<ol>
									<li> Fruits: Banans, Apples, Oranges etc. (also great for micro-nutrition)</li>
									<li> High Glycemic White Bread, Rice & Pasta</li>
									<li> Sugary foods: Sweets, Chocolate Bars, Ice Cream (bad for health in large quantities)</li>
								</ol>

									Fat is essential in muscle building (unless you are taking a growth hormone), this is because fat is responsible for the amount of testosterone that is produced in your body. Why is this important? This is because
									this extra testosterone present in your body helps you to lift more weight, why do you think people who intake grown hormones (steroids) into their body gain muscle mass and strength at a considerably increased pace?
									It's because their testosterone levels are considerably higher then a natural weightlifter. Under NO circumstances whatsoever should you undertake a low-fat diet if you are bodybuilding drug-free
									<h5>Good Healthy Fats</h5>
									<b>Unsaturated Fat</b> is the only type of fat I recommend you supplement into your diet. Unsaturated fat is present in many different sources of food; which also provide high amounts of protein which makes them 
									considerably favourable to Vegan and Vegetarian Bodybuilders alike. Below are a list of foods that are high in Unsaturated Fat:
									<ol>
										<li> Olive oil, rape seed oil, sunflower oils </li>
										<li> Almond & Cashew Nuts</li>
										<li> Avocados </li>
									</ol>
