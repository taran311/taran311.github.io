			<h1> Training </h1>
			<h2> What workout routine do I need? </h2>
			<p> Before I start, let's face some facts here, the workout routine optimal for your progression is dependant upon your end goal. Typically weightlifting
			is broken down into Powerlifting, Bodybuilding and Olympic Lifting. Powerlifting and Olympic Lifting revolve around strength progression and Bodybuilding 
			revolves around muscle progression. </p>
			<ul>
				<li> If you want are looking for optimal <b> Strength Progression </b> you will likely be looking for a workout routine consisting of heavy compound movements
				in a strength training rep range of 4-6 reps with a few accessory movements, however if that is the case then the likelyhood is that <u> this website
				is not for you! </u> </li>
				<li> Okay moving onto my target audience, my fellow aspiring Bodybuilders! Our end goal is of course to gain optimal <b> Muscle Progression </b>,
				now for a natural we can realistically hope to obtain around 5lbs of muscle per year until we hit our genetic potential for the most amount of muscle our bodies 
				can <u>naturally</u> obtain. To maximise our muscle growth we must first understand the importance of Protein Synthesis </li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2> Why is Upper/Lower Split best for Natural Bodybuilding? </h2>
			<p> For <u>Bodybuilding</u> the reason an Upper/Lowerbody workout routine is optimal for a natural athlete is simple. It revolves around providing rest to muscle groups 
			that have been worked out within the last 72 hours. <u>Why 72 hours of rest?</u> <b>Protein Synthesis</b> is elevated up to 48-72 hour after heavy resistance training,
			so your body will experience muscle progression over the duration of this time. It would almost be redundant to workout the same muscle groups within this duration
			since they will still be rebuilding and it is best to let them recover for your next workout which involves those same muscle groups. For instance, I work out all upper-body
			muscle groups on a <u>Monday</u> so it is ideal for me to allow all those muscle groups to rebuild during the 72 hour process of elevated Protein Synthesis and have my next upper-body
			workout on the upcoming <u>Thursday</u>. </p>
			Below is a good example of an Upper/Lowerbody Split workout.
